## The Problem

At work, I was stuck doing a repetitive and time-consuming task.  
I needed to check that a .csv file had the correct format, contained valid data,  
and that everything was properly organized for importing into a database used by a dialer called Vicidial.

After doing this for a while, I started to notice patterns that I could turn into algorithms.  
That realization made me think about automating the process, and that's how V-Parse was born.
